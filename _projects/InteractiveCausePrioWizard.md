An application (web or command-line) that guides you through the cause prioritization process, like an interactive version of the EA flowcharts (e.g. [Malde 2022](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TCtbuGC3yBisToXxZ/a-guided-cause-prioritisation-flowchart), [Cotton-Barratt and Kokotajlo 2015](http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/09/flowhart/)). The wizard would ask you questions and automatically determine which causes are the most important based on your answers. It could also take into account your level of confidence (as a probability or percent) for answers to individual questions and weight the causes accordingly.
