Main document: "[Proposal: A central, editable database to help people choose and do research projects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yo73wsFQHNs7Vq78mm387PGdXuV1qmizGB_s_lrS_ME/edit)" by Michael Aird

See also: "[A central directory for open research questions](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MsNpJBzv5YhdfNHc9/a-central-directory-for-open-research-questions)." Basically this but more usable and searchable.
