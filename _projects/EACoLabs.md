EA CoLabs is a project that attempts to match EA volunteers with volunteering
opportunities within EA.

The project is lead by a small team of passionate Effective Altruists, who are
currently learning more about how to get better at matching volunteers.

The current project is a google site, with a backend in airtable. The [site can
be found here](https://www.impactprojects.org/).
