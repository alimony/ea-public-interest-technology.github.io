Pedant is a math DSL made for Cost Effectiveness Analysis. It's designed to make
it easier to do Cost Effectiveness Analysis, and that when an analysis is done,
it's done correctly.

Pedant's main current feature is dimensional analysis. This helps check calculations
for hidden assumptions that might exist when doing calculations. But in the future
I intend to use it to be able to account for uncertainty in parameters and also
make explorable webpages of Cost Effectiveness Analysis.

[Pedant is on GitHub](https://github.com/Hazelfire/pedant) and written in Haskell.
Sam Nolan is currently main developer on this project, but I get feedback from
Quinn and Ozzie.
