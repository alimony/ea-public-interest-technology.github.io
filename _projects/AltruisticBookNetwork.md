The [Altruistic Book Network](https://altruisticbook.net/) is an attempt to sell
second hand books to raise money for effective charities. All proceeds from these
book sales go to GiveWell's maximum impact fund.

The bookstore is currently run by Sam Nolan, and he is looking for help on running
it. Mainly trying to drive sales and organizing the business to be efficient.
